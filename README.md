Iterative material removal

von Mises stress criterion

Safety factor evaluation

📊 Iteration Results
Iteration	Mass (g)	Max Stress (MPa)	FOS	Displacement (mm)
Baseline	75.78	108.5	5.71	0.0695
Final	25.49	228	2.72	0.189
📉 Final Performance

66% mass reduction

FOS within optimal engineering range (2–3)

Stress below yield limit

Structurally stable design


📎 Key Engineering Insights

Weight reduction increases stress non-linearly.

Optimal design achieved near FOS ≈ 2.7.

Further material removal would compromise safety margin.

Convergence verified through mesh refinement.
